**Folder Overview**
===============

This folder contains the source code for a web scraping project specifically designed to scrape real estate listings. The project utilizes the Scrapy framework, a popular Python library used for building web scrapers.

**Subfolder Contents**
--------------------

### `real_estate_scraper/spiders`

*   **real_estate_spider.py**

    *   **Description:** This file contains the main class definition for the real estate spider. It inherits from Scrapy's `Spider` class and defines custom methods for handling HTTP requests, parsing HTML responses, and extracting data.

        The spider is responsible for navigating to the target website, retrieving data on real estate listings, and storing it in a structured format. This file serves as the core logic for scraping the web pages.
*   **__init__.py**

    *   **Description:** This file serves as an empty namespace module. It allows Python to treat this directory as a package by importing modules within it.

        The `__init__.py` file is used to organize related files and make them importable, but in this case, its presence does not contribute any code or functionality to the spider.
*   **Other Files**

    *   ... (other spider-specific files)

**Functionality Overview**
==========================

The contents of this folder are designed to work together seamlessly. The `real_estate_spider.py` file contains the core logic for scraping real estate listings, including handling HTTP requests and extracting data from HTML responses.

The `__init__.py` file allows us to structure our spider into a package that can be easily imported and used in other projects. This organization helps to maintain cleanliness, readability, and reusability of code.

Overall, this folder provides a well-structured foundation for building web scrapers focused on real estate listings using Scrapy.
